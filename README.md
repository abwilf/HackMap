# What is a HackMap?
HackMap is a spatially based alternative to the bulleted list.  

Like a bulleted list, it is meant to help users organize thoughts or tasks by categories and subcategories.  While a bulleted list accomplishes this through nesting and different symbols for bullet points at each level, a HackMap allows users to visualize this hierarchy more spatially as a tree structure, and to specify the type of connection between a parent and child node.  

This specificity allows users access to simple but important functionalities such as separating visions (what something is, or should be) from actions (how to achieve it) that cannot be accomplished through types of connections that are uniform across levels (as in a bulleted list).

You can find more information about this system on [this page](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~abwilf/mapping.html).
